# EDA-on-FIFA-dataset
An extensive EDA project on dataset called "Players_20.csv" dataset available open source on kaggle.
The datasets provided include the players data for the Career Mode from FIFA 15 to FIFA 20 ("players_20.csv"). The data allows multiple comparison of the same players across the last 6 version of the videogame.

This EDA project allowed me to learn some more data scraping modules provided by MatplotLib and Seaborn as I tried to create complex analytical frames.
This time I went ahead and tried on some unknown source to understand what the dataset is really trying to convey.
