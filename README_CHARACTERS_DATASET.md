# EDA on Characters Dataset
A basic EDA project on the dataset called "character.csv" available open source on kaggle. The dataset consists data about characters form comic books from Marvel and DC publications.

i have created some logically understandable and visually pleasing data models using matplotlib and seaborn libraries on python. Numerical calculations were done using Numpy library.

This project introduced me to the core of data analytics and data visualization and built my interest in the field of data analytics and data visualization.
